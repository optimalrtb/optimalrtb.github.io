<p>
	In display and mobile advertising, the most significant development in recent years is the Real-Time Bidding (RTB), which allows selling and buying in real-time one ad impression at a time. The ability of making impression level bid decision and targeting to an individual user in real-time has fundamentally changed the landscape of the digital media.  The further demand for automation, integration and optimisation in RTB brings new research opportunities in the IR fields, including information matching with economic constraints, CTR prediction, user behaviour targeting and profiling, personalised advertising, and attribution and evaluation methodologies. In this tutorial, teamed up with presenters from both the industry and academia, we aim to bring the insightful knowledge from the real-world systems, and to provide an overview of the fundamental mechanism and algorithms with the focus on the IR context. We will also introduce to CIKM researchers a few datasets recently made available so that they can get hands-on quickly and enable the said research.

<p><a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/Weinan.Zhang">Weinan Zhang</a> recently received his Ph.D. from University College London and is now an assistant professor in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. His research interests include machine learning, dynamic optimisation and their applications in RTB based display advertising and recommender systems. Particularly, He focuses on the research of optimal DSP bidding strategies for RTB display advertising. He is also interested in deep learning models and has developed several domain-specified DNNs for predicting users' online commercial behaviours. Weinan Zhang has published more than 20 papers in top international conferences including SIGKDD, CIKM, SIGIR, AAAI, RecSys and WI. He also has made publications in well-recognised journals including ACM TIST, IPM, and JMLR. He and Dr. Shuai Yuan won the final session of iPinyou Global Bidding Algorithm Competition in 2013. <br /> <br /> <br /></p>
